### Hi there ! I am Moses, a Cloud computing Engineer 

I hold the role of a Junior Software Engineer, possessing expertise in deploying and overseeing cloud infrastructure with hands-on knowledge of IaaC services like, CloudFormation, Terraform and Ansible. I demonstrate proficiency in various AWS services including CloudWatch, S3, DynamoDB, VPC, EC2, IAM Users & Roles, Lambda, and serverless architecture. Additionally, I am adept in utilizing Linux, Bash and Python.


I utilize Drow.io for crafting AWS architecture diagrams, enabling me to visually represent and convey infrastructure design and dependencies to both team members and stakeholders. This practice enhances team efficiency, ensuring timely, budget-conscious, and high-quality project deliveries. In essence, I advocate for robust documentation, agile methodologies, and visualization tools like Drow.io as crucial elements for project success, integrating them into my daily workflow consistently.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently hold AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification and  working on archiving AWS Solution Architect. I am also working on AWS projects which I will be uplading on here on a repository named Projects
